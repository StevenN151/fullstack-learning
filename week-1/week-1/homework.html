    <h1>The Coding Adventure</h1>

    <div>
      <p>
        Once upon a time in the kingdom of JavaScript, there lived a coder named
        Bob. Bob was on a quest to conquer the mighty
        <a href="https://google.com">Bug Mountain</a> , where bugs of all shapes
        and sizes dwelled.
      </p>

        alt="Click me"
      />

      <script>
        const image = document.getElementById('BobImage');
        image.addEventListener('click', function () {
          alert('Bob is clicked!');
        });
      </script>
    </div>

      <p>
        Armed with his keyboard and a mug of coffee, Bob bravely faced syntax
        monsters and wrestled with the elusive null dragons. But his greatest
        nemesis was the mighty <a href="https://google.com">Bug Queen</a> ,who
        hid in the deep dungeons of the codebase.

        With a clever strategy and a sprinkle of humor, Bob defeated the Bug
        Queen and emerged victorious. The kingdom celebrated with joyous console
        logs, and Bob became a legendary coder known for his wit and coding
        prowess.
